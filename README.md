# MongoDB Aggregation Error: Incorrect Use of $unwind in $group Stage

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines involving the `$unwind` operator within a `$group` stage. The incorrect usage can lead to unexpected and incorrect results.

## Problem
The `$unwind` operator deconstructs an array field from the input documents, outputting a separate document for each element in the array. When used within a `$group` stage, it can cause unexpected data aggregation if not handled properly. This example showcases a scenario where unwinding an array field and then using `$group` results in incorrect data aggregation.

## Solution
The solution involves restructuring the aggregation pipeline to avoid unintended consequences of `$unwind` in the context of `$group`. We explore alternative approaches to achieve the desired data aggregation without encountering this error.  This ensures the correct data aggregation happens with predictable results.
